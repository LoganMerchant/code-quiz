# Code Quiz

## Description
Provides users with a short quiz on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. They are given a series of questions and must try to answer them before the timer runs out. Once all questions are answered, or when the timer reaches 0, the user is told whether or not they beat the high score. If they did, they are given the opportunity to save their name and score to `localStorage`.
